# Project Manager

WebSight Designs initially created this project manager to manage our web design projects. We found that while there are quite a few solutions out there for tracking tasks, communicating with clients, and creating email/pdf invoices, there weren't any solutions which could do all of the above from one web application. So like any self-respecting web development firm, we decided to create our own.

Initially we simply coded the web application to our own specific needs, but we quickly realized this would be a useful tool for other organizations as well. So we decided to rewrite it again from scratch, this time allowing the addition or removal of various functionality through plugins. For instance, the Invoices plugin can be removed if your organization doesn't require invoicing clients. Or the GANTT View plugin can be loaded if you wish to view your tasks and/or milestones in GANTT view mode.

## Requirements

This web application is intended to be cloned and placed on a web server running Apache, PHP and MySQL. Currently only Linux is supported, though we intend to add in support for Windows web servers in the future. Version 5.4+ of PHP is recommended, we developed this application on PHP 5.4. Version of 5+ MySQL is recommended, we developed this application on MySQL 5.
